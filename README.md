1. On the index page, enter in a given (first) name in the first field.
2. Enter a family (last) name in the second field.
3. Click the button to submit. 
4. The query will take a few seconds. The information should populate the page for the queried patient.

The data this application is querying is fake, simulated data so the names are particular. There are three names provided on the index page that are known working names.

## About
This project was made to showcase the use of Node as a back-end library, the use of Presto for sql queries, and to utalize the 1up Health api.

Information about the data and 1up Health can be found here: http://34.74.56.14/index.html
